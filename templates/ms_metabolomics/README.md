### Overview
The purpose for this template is to harmonize the metadata collection for metabolomics experiments performed using mass spectrometry and support the submission to the [Metabolomics Workbench](https://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/) repository. 

These templates were developed by the [Michigan Sate University Superfund Research Center Data Management and Analysis Core](https://iit.msu.edu/centers/superfund/) and are intended to be used with [_DataHarmonizer_](https://github.com/cidgoh/DataHarmonizer):

#### 1.  Familiarize yourself with _DataHarmonizer_<br>

Before beginning to collect your (meta)data it is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with [_DataHarmonizer_](https://github.com/cidgoh/DataHarmonizer#usage) created by the Centre for Infectious Disease Genomics and One Health (CIDGOH), at Simon Fraser University. See the following video for an overview of _DataHarmonizer_.

#### _Notes_:
- __DataHarmonizer will not save your progress.__ It is good practice to save your work and upload the output next time you want to work on (meta)data collection.
- If you decide to fill some of the data offline using Excel, ensure that you meet the expectations for individual fields. These can be verified by uploading and validating.
